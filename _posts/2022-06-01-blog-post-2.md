CBI program (Chemistry-Biology Interface) is a highly competitive UMass-funded and NIH-funded fellowship, aiming at training trainees from different background to advance scientific research "at the interface of chemistry and biology".

## What I did so far as a CBI trainee

1. Drug design course
   - Understand drug development process, including drug discovery, screening, optimization and clinical trials;
   - Computational aided drug discovery and Structural-based drug design;
   - Macromolecular drug development, such as antibody, DNA and RNA.
2. CBI chalk talk
   - [CBI chalk talk](https://cbi.chem.umass.edu/activities/chalk-talk/) is a course that is monthly held to gather CBI community to disscuss cutting edge topics.
3. attend workshops
   - I attended a OPT workshop "Crafting Slides for Engaging Presentations" (Nov 16th). I also made my own [logo](/images/logo9.png) and [PPT template](/files/Jian_umass.thmx).
4. CBI traineeship talk
   - As a CBI trainee, I was requested to give a talk to both chemistry and biology students
   - The talk topic: **Hydrophobic gating in bundle-crossing ion channels: a case study of TRPV4"**
5. Future plan
