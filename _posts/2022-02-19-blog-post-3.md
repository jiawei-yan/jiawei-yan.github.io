The BPS 2022 66-th annual meeting was held in 19th Feb 2022 at San Francisco, California.<br>

During this meeting, I presented a post about the new findings of TMEM16F, including:

1. A conductive/open state of mTMEM16F induced by inner gate charged mutations was identified during atomistic simulations. (see [TMEM16F](/research/0-TMEM16F)) 
2. The predicted state is permeable to ions and lipids, which further reveals the ion and lipid pathways (as well as underlying mechanisms) of this protein.

This was a fun trip! All Chen lab members gathered and enjoyed the meeting. We even had a fascinating road trip to get back to MA.
