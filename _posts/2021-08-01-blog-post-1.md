After a year-long remote study in China, I finally arrived at U.S. and met with Chen lab members!

Thanks to Erik and Xiping's help. In order to get me to Amherst, they rented a car. They also shared many useful tips about living in UMass. We quickly got familiar with each other and now we are good friends.
Many thanks to them again! Without you guys, the journey would never be so smooth and interesting.
